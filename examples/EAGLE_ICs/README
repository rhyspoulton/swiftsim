This directory contains initial conditions generated for
the EAGLE suite of simulations. The cosmology, resolution
and phases are the same as used in the original suite. The only
difference is the file format, adapted for SWIFT.

For standard runs, the code should be configured with

--with-subgrid=EAGLE-XL --with-hydro=sphenix --with-kernel=wendland-C2

Compared to the original EAGLE runs of Schaye et al. 2015),
the following changes have been made (at standard resolution):

 - The dark matter softening lengths have been increased to 1.3
   pkpc and 3.32 ckpc. The comoving baryon softening lengths have
   been changed to 1.79 ckpc. This follows the recommendations of
   Ludlow et al. 2019. Old values were 0.7 pkpc and 2.69 ckpc for
   all the particle species.
 - SPH particles with a mass larger than 7*10^6 Msun (~4x the initial
   gas particle mass) are now split into 2 equal mass particles
   within the smoothing length of the original particle.
 - The metallicity-dependent density threshold for star formation
   uses the smoothed metallicities and not the raw metallicities
   any more.
 - The cooling uses the Ploeckinger+20 tables including an updated
   UV background, newer version of CLOUDY and self-shielding
   (was using the Wiersma+09 tables before).
 - The redshift of H reionization has been lowered to 7.5 (from 11.5).
 - The entropy floor between n_H = 10^-5 and 10^-1 cm^3 at 8000K has
   been removed as the new cooling tables handle this correctly. The
   gamma=4/3 floor has been extended to lower densities
   (i.e. 800K at n_H = 10^-4 cm^-3) as a fail-safe.
 - Particles can be star-forming if they are within 0.3 dex of the
   entropy floor (was 0.5 dex). These particles also get their
   subgrid properties (rho, T) computed.
 - The minimal mass of SNII stars has been raised to 8 Msun (from 6).
 - The SNII feedback delay is done by sampling the stellar age
   distribution and not using a fixed delay of 30 Myr any more.
 - The halo mass for BH seeding has been lowered to 10^10 M_sun
   (from 10^10/h Msun).
 - The black hole accretion rate is now limited to 100% of the
   Eddington rate (from 100/h = 150 %).
 - The circular velocity threshold for BH mergers is measured
   at the actual distance linking the BHs not at the kernel support
   length any more.
 - The BHs can reposition only onto gas particles and not onto any
   type as before.
 - The maximal relative velocity between a BH and gas particle
   eligible to be a reposition target has been increased to 0.5 times
   the local sound-speed around the BH (was 0.25 * c_sound).


The scripts in this directory download the tables required to
run the EAGLE model. Plotting scripts are also provided
for basic quantities.

VELOCIraptor can be run on the output. The code is compiled
using

cmake -DVR_USE_GAS=ON -DVR_USE_STAR=ON -DV_USE_BH=ON

and run using

stf -C vrconfig_3dfof_subhalos_SO_hydro.cfg -i eagle_0036 -o halos_0036 -I 2
